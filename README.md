Hi, Iâ€™m @Leo-Campo, complete name's Leonardo Campitelli. I'm a recently graduated Computer Science Engineer aching to put my studies to the test while developing new tehcniques and methodologies. My main desire is to develop useful programs and applications to solve problems and needs, and I do love to code.

As of now I'm working as a Software Engineering for an italian insurance company, getting to know the world outside of school and education. I love to
discover new technologies and tools to help me become a better Developer and Software Engineer. I'll upload on github my main works and projects 
I've been working on.

In my free time I study and try out different technologies and programming languages, with a soft spot for Machine Learning and Neural Network techniques,
which may be described as my two main area of expertise. Nontheless I'm a flexible developer open to all kinds of projects, as long as they are interesting
and let me get my hands dirty.

I do strive to provide readable and maintainable code with my personal signature on it and I'm starting to take my GitHub profile more seriously.

You can find me here on Github, using the github email provided. My LinkedIn profile is https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-campitelli-7379a2200/
