Hi, Iâ€™m @Leo-Campo, complete name's Leonardo Campitelli. I'm a Computer Engineer aching to put my studies to the test while developing my own developing style. My main desire is to develop useful programs and applications to solve problems and needs, and I do love to code.

As of now I'm working as a Software Engineering in Italy, getting to know the world outside of school and education. I love to
discover new technologies and tools to help me become a better Developer and Software Engineer. I'll upload on github my main works and projects 
I've been working on.

In my free time I study and try out different technologies and programming languages, with a soft spot for Machine Learning and Neural Network techniques,
Nontheless I'm a flexible developer open to all kinds of projects, as long as they are interesting
and let me get my hands dirty. I do strive to provide readable and maintainable code with my personal signature on it.

I'm currently on a journey to improve my contributions here on Github on take my profile here more seriously, feel free to reach out! 

Let's code something awesome together!
